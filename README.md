# hospital-occupancy-tracker
reads daily updated content from pdf, extracts and plots data, saves results to csv file
<br>
tracks occupancy rates in local emergency rooms
<br>
updates every day at 12:00pm -> <b>paused for now</b>, as pdf does not seem to be accessible through github :[
<p>
note to myself:<br> 
  <i>to run on macos, XQuartz needs to be installed in github actions file before pdftools is installed. 
    <br>
    Add "run: brew install xquartz --cask" to yml file</i>
